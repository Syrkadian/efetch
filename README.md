# efetch
Evidence Fetcher (efetch) fetches evidence files and folders either directly or using one if its many plugins. It has an easily customized web interface made up of many different Plugins. Efetch's interface is modified by simply adding, removing, and/or reordering plugins from the URL.

Plugins are simple to create. They can be designed to run on files, groups of files, and/or directories. There are no restrictions on the plugins, so they do not need to be pure python. Unlike many other tools, it is not discouraged to have redundant, disposable, or primitive plugins.
