# efetch
Evidence Fetcher (efetch) fetches evidence using a dfVFS pathspec and displays it it using one of its many plugins.

Plugins are simple to create. They can be designed to run on files, groups of files, and/or directories. There are no restrictions on the plugins, so they do not need to be pure python. Unlike many other tools, it is NOT discouraged to have redundant, disposable, or primitive plugins.
