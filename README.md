# efetch
Evidence Fetcher (efetch) fetches evidence files and folders either directly or using one if its many plugins. Efetch manages all evidence and plugins. It is also designed to be fully restful.

Plugins are simple to create. They can be designed to run on files, groups of files, and/or directories. There are no restrictions on the plugins, so they do not need to be pure python. Unlike many other tools, it is not discouraged to have redundant, disposable, or primitive plugins.

Efetch has a built in directory viewer, thumbnail viewer, and plugin manager.
